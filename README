Quantum 2 by Carlos Barbosa

Quantum it's a php framework built for ultra fast web development.

It was built for php programmers who want to get things done fast and well done.

It integrates PHP-Activerecord and Smarty, which make it super powerful.

It features a command line tool for creating models, controllers & views:

For building a controller:

cd quantum/script

./teleport -c name=blog //Teleports a blog controller
./teleport -m name=post //teleports a post model
./teleport -v controller=blog action=index // teleport an index view

Controllers are intended to expose the public functions only, so you can get away with:

A full blog controller in 3 mins:

class BlogController
{

	function __construct()
	{
	$this->setTemplate('cms);

	}
	
	function index()
	{
		$posts = Post::all();
		
		$this->set('posts', $posts);
	
	}
	
	function new()
	{
		$this->createPostHook();
	
	}
	
	function post()
	{
		if isset($this->getData['id'])
		{
			$post = Post::find_by_id($this->getData['id']);
			
			if (empty($post))
			{
				redirect_to('/blog');
				
			}
			
			$this->set('post', $post);
		}
	
	}
	
	private function createPostHook()
	{
		if (isset($this->postData['title]))
		{
		
			$post = new Post();
			$post->title = $this->postData['title];
			$post->save();
			
			$this->set('success' 1);
		
		}
		
	
	}	

}

And in your view for example:

(app/views/blog/index.tpl);

{section name=posts loop=posts}

{$posts[posts]->title}
{$posts[posts]->title}

{/section}

While most of it is not documented, it has been working for years in many web apps, particularly facebook apps, which is suited for it nicely.

Full features:

PHP-Activerecord
Smarty
Teleport command line tool
QLoader (javascript loader)
Quantum Javascript framework, a framework for building huge js apps, really nicely, it automatically compiles tons of js into one single file
Full featured Template system ($this->setTemplate('something')); just drop a header.tpl and footer.tpl into a directory inside the templates folder.
Multi sites, (work on staging, dev & production from a single codebase, no hacks required just set up your config/environment.php, works by detecting the current domain so you can work on yousite.dev yoursitestaging.com and yoursiteproduction.com and just git push somewhere)
Full MVC architecture.
